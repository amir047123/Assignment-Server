The code imports the necessary dependencies: express, promoRouter (Express router), and the Promotion model from "../Schema/promotion".

Three HTTP routes are defined under the promoRouter:

POST /promotions: Creates a new promotion. It expects the promotion data in the request body and uses the Promotion.create() method to save the promotion to the database.

DELETE /promotions/:promoId: Deletes a promotion by its ID. It retrieves the promoId from the request parameters and uses the Promotion.findByIdAndDelete() method to find and delete the promotion.

PUT /promotions/:promoId: Updates a promotion by its ID. It retrieves the promoId from the request parameters and uses the Promotion.findByIdAndUpdate() method to find and update the promotion with the new data provided in the request body.

Each route contains error handling code to catch any exceptions that might occur during the database operations. If an error occurs, an appropriate error response is sent back to the client.

The promoRouter is exported to be used in the main Express application.

To use this code, you would need to define the Promotion model and set up the necessary database connection using Mongoose. Additionally, you would need to configure your main Express application to use the promoRouter for the "/promotions" route.

Overall, this code provides the basic functionality for creating, deleting, and updating promotions in a RESTful manner.
