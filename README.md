# Lab Assignment 
This is a Node.js project that requires the use of environment variables. In order to run the project locally or in a production environment, you need to set up a `.env` file.

## Setting up the .env file

1. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.
2. Define the following environment variables in the `.env` file:



Replace `VARIABLE_NAME` with the actual variable name and `value` with the corresponding value. Add more variables as required for your project.

3. Make sure to add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being committed to version control.

Here's an example of how the `.env` file structure should look:


Please note that you should replace the example values with your own values specific to your development environment.

By following these instructions and setting up the `.env` file correctly, you'll ensure that the project runs with the appropriate environment variables in place.

The code imports the necessary dependencies: express, promoRouter (Express router), and the Promotion model from "../Schema/promotion".

Three HTTP routes are defined under the promoRouter:

POST /promotions: Creates a new promotion. It expects the promotion data in the request body and uses the Promotion.create() method to save the promotion to the database.

DELETE /promotions/:promoId: Deletes a promotion by its ID. It retrieves the promoId from the request parameters and uses the Promotion.findByIdAndDelete() method to find and delete the promotion.

PUT /promotions/:promoId: Updates a promotion by its ID. It retrieves the promoId from the request parameters and uses the Promotion.findByIdAndUpdate() method to find and update the promotion with the new data provided in the request body.

Each route contains error handling code to catch any exceptions that might occur during the database operations. If an error occurs, an appropriate error response is sent back to the client.

The promoRouter is exported to be used in the main Express application.

To use this code, you would need to define the Promotion model and set up the necessary database connection using Mongoose. Additionally, you would need to configure your main Express application to use the promoRouter for the "/promotions" route.

Overall, this code provides the basic functionality for creating, deleting, and updating promotions in a RESTful manner.

Clone the project: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project, and run the following command:
git clone <repository-url>

Replace <repository-url> with the URL of the project repository.

npm install

Install dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the required dependencies specified in the package.json file:

Configuration: If there are any configuration files required for the project (such as environment variables), make sure to set them up correctly. Refer to the project's documentation or README for any specific configuration instructions.

Run the project: Once the dependencies are installed and the project is configured, you can start the project by running the following command:

npm start

Access the application: After running the project, the application should be accessible at the specified URL or port. If not mentioned in the documentation, it is usually http://localhost:3000 by default. Open a web browser and navigate to the appropriate URL to access the application.

Note: The exact steps may vary depending on the project and its specific requirements. It's always a good idea to refer to the project's documentation or README for any specific instructions or variations.
