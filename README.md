# Lab Assignment 

This is a Node.js project that requires the use of environment variables. In order to run the project locally or in a production environment, you need to set up a `.env` file.

## Setting up the .env file

1. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.
2. Define the following environment variables in the `.env` file:


Replace `VARIABLE_NAME` with the actual variable name and `value` with the corresponding value. Add more variables as required for your project.

3. Make sure to add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being committed to version control.

Here's an example of how the `.env` file structure should look:

Please note that you should replace the example values with your own values specific to your development environment.

By following these instructions and setting up the `.env` file correctly, you'll ensure that the project runs with the appropriate environment variables in place.
